## Pizza Sales Analysis
I've developed a comprehensive dashboard for pizza sales, leveraging the power of Microsoft Power BI and integrating it with a Microsoft SQL Server database. The dashboard is constructed using Power Query, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), and advanced Power BI techniques to extract meaningful insights from the data.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
# 1.Total Revenue: Track the overall income generated from pizza sales.
# 2.Average Order Value: Understand the average value of each customer order.
# 3.Total Pizzas Sold: Monitor the overall quantity of pizzas sold.
# 4.Total Orders: Keep track of the total number of orders placed.
# 5.Average Pizzas Per Order: Analyze the average number of pizzas per customer order

# Daily Trends for Total Orders:
- Visualize the day-wise variations in the total number of orders.
- Identify and highlight days with the highest sales of pizzas.

# Monthly Trends for Orders:
- Observe month-wise trends to discern patterns in pizza sales.
- Pinpoint months with the highest sales, providing a macro-level overview.

# Insights:
- Uncover actionable insights to optimize sales and customer satisfaction.
- Identify peak sales periods, allowing for targeted marketing strategies.

# Comparative Analysis with SQL Queries:
- Validate the accuracy of Power BI insights by comparing results with SQL queries.
- Ensure data consistency and reliability between the two methods.

This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for pizza sales analysis, providing a visually appealing and data-driven platform to make informed business decisions. The integration of Power BI with Microsoft SQL Server ensures real-time and accurate insights, while the use of Power Query and DAX facilitates advanced analytics for a deeper understanding of pizza sales dynamics. Feel free to explore the visualizations and utilize the insights to enhance your business strategies
